![bwc-logo](http://brunch.io/images/svg/brunch.svg)

This is HTML5 application, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).

## Installation
Clone this repo manually with git or use `brunch new gh:dobromir-hristov/brunch-with-whey-protein`

## Getting started

    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`.
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
